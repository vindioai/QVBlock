## 📖 Quantum Vision (QV) Theory in Deep Learning

Inspired by quantum physics, **Quantum Vision (QV)** theory introduces a completely new perspective for object recognition using deep learning.  

QV takes captured still images of objects and converts them into **information wave functions** using a deep learning module called the **QV Block**.  

The QV Block can be integrated into:
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- Vision Transformers (ViTs)
- Convolutional Vision Transformers (CCTs)

These integrations produce **QV model variants** for object classification.

### 🔬 Key Highlights
- Converts image data into information wave functions.
- Enhances existing vision architectures by integrating the QV Block.
- Demonstrated **consistent performance improvements** across multiple datasets compared to standalone models.
- Easy Python API for quick experimentation

## Python Usage

### 🛠️ Installation
```bash
# Install via pip 
pip install vindioai

```
### 🚀 Integrating QVBlock into Your Deep Learning Model (Check Sample Codes for QV-CNN-Heavy, QV-ViT-8-8 for more details)

```python
import vindioai
from vindioai import QVBlock, Init_Freeze_ShiftSubtract_Layers

# default wave is 128. For more computationally efficient training, wave values can be reduced to 64, 32, 16, 8
wave=128

# For small image size (64, 64 , 3) use momentum_magnitude of either [1] or [1, 2].
#[1] creates 4 parallel branches, while [1, 2] created 8 parallel branches

# For large image sizes (224, 224 , 3) use momentum_magnitude of either [2] or [2, 4]
#[2] creates 4 parallel branches, while [2, 4] created 8 parallel branches

momentum_magnitude=np.array([1, 2])

# Get QV Block
QV_block = QVBlock(momentum_magnitude=momentum_magnitude, input_shape=(64, 64, 3), conv_layers=3, waves=wave)

inputs = QV_block.input
infowave = QV_block.output

# QV_block is now ready to be integrated into your deep learning model

# In QV-CNN-Heavy(CIFAR-10).py and QV-ViT-8-8(CIFAR-10).py sample codes, you can see how QV INFORMATION WAVES can be feed to your deep learning model

# CNN example below

convafter1 = Conv2D(128, (3, 3), padding='same', activation=None,
             use_bias=True, name='convafter1')(infowave)

#...

output = Dense(10, activation = 'softmax')(flat)

model = Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=output)

# Must initialize and freeze the weight learning for QVBlock shift and subtract conv layers
model=Init_Freeze_ShiftSubtract_Layers(model, wave, momentum_magnitude=momentum_magnitude)

# Now compile your model as usual
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

```

### 🚀 Try QVBlock on Your Dataset 

Check Sample Codes for QV-CNN-Heavy(CIFAR-10).py and QV-ViT-8-8(CIFAR-10).py in the main branch.

Here instead of loading the CIFAR-10, load your dataset from a local drive or from an online resource.

In the deep learning model, adjust the number of classes in the softmax layer and then train your model.

Optimize your QV hyperparameters, momentum_magnitude, conv_layers, waves if needed!
