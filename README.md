## 📖 Quantum Vision (QV) Theory in Deep Learning

Inspired by quantum physics, **Quantum Vision (QV)** theory introduces a completely new perspective for object recognition using deep learning.  

QV takes captured still images of objects and converts them into **information wave functions** using a deep learning module called the **QV Block**.  

The QV Block can be integrated into:
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- Vision Transformers (ViTs)
- Convolutional Vision Transformers (CvTs)

These integrations produce **QV model variants** for object classification.

### 🔬 Key Highlights
- Converts image data into information wave functions.
- Enhances existing vision architectures by integrating the QV Block.
- Demonstrated **consistent performance improvements** across multiple datasets compared to standalone models.

### 📜 License

Quantum Vision Theory in Deep Learning for Object Recognition is licensed under the **AGPL-3.0** license for research and non-commercial use.  
You are free to use, modify, and share the code and models under the terms of the AGPL-3.0 license.
However, if you create any derivative works or deploy them (including via a network service), you must release your modifications and the full source code under the same AGPL-3.0 license.

**Commercial / Closed-source Use**  
If you want to integrate Quantum Vision Theory into a closed-source or proprietary product without releasing your source code, you must obtain an **Enterprise License** from the Vindio AI Software Ltd, https://vindioai.com/

**License Summary**

| Use Case                                   | Free? | Must Release Source Code? | License Type           |
|--------------------------------------------|-------|---------------------------|------------------------|
| Academic / research (non-commercial)       | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes (if modified/distributed) | AGPL-3.0               |
| Personal experiments / hobby projects      | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes (if shared publicly) | AGPL-3.0               |
| Open-source commercial product             | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes                     | AGPL-3.0               |
| Closed-source commercial product           | ❌ No  | ❌ No (with Enterprise License) | Enterprise License     |

**Key Point:** If you use Quantum Vision in a product or service and **do not** want to release your own source code under AGPL-3.0,  
you **must** purchase an Enterprise License.
