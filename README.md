## 📖 Quantum Vision (QV) Theory in Deep Learning

Inspired by quantum physics, **Quantum Vision (QV)** theory introduces a completely new perspective for object recognition using deep learning.  

QV takes captured still images of objects and converts them into **information wave functions** using a deep learning module called the **QV Block**.  

The QV Block can be integrated into:
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- Vision Transformers (ViTs)
- Convolutional Vision Transformers (CvTs)

These integrations produce **QV model variants** for object classification.

### 🔬 Key Highlights
- Converts image data into information wave functions.
- Enhances existing vision architectures by integrating the QV Block.
- Demonstrated **consistent performance improvements** across multiple datasets compared to standalone models.
- Easy Python API for quick experimentation

## 🐍 Python Usage

### 🛠️ Installation
```bash
# Install via pip (will be available soon on PyPI)
pip install vindioai

```
### 🚀 Integrating QVBlock into Your Deep Learning Model (Check the CNN, ViT and CvT integration codes for more details)

```python
import vindioai
from vindioai import QVBlock, Init_Freeze_ShiftSubtract_Layers

# default wave is 128. For more computationally efficient training, wave values can be reduced to 64, 32, 16, 8
wave=128

# For small image size (64, 64 , 3) use momentum_direction of either [1] or [1, 2].
#[1] creates 4 parallel branches, while [1, 2] created 8 parallel branches

# For large image sizes (224, 224 , 3) use momentum_direction of either [2] or [2, 4]
#[2] creates 4 parallel branches, while [2, 4] created 8 parallel branches

momentum_direction=np.array([1, 2])

# Get QV Block
QV_block = QVBlock(momentum_direction=momentum_direction, input_shape=(64, 64, 3), conv_layers=3, waves=wave)

inputs = QV_block.input
infowave = QV_block.output

# QV_block is now ready to be integrated into your deep learning model

#..... Add your layers such as
# QV INFORMATION WAVES FEED TO A CNN ARCHITECTURE OR VIT OR CvT, CNN example below

convafter1 = Conv2D(128, (3, 3), padding='same', activation=None,
             use_bias=True, name='convafter1')(infowave)

#...

output = Dense(10, activation = 'softmax')(flat)

model = Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=output)

# Must initialize and freeze the weight learning for QVBlock shift and subtract conv layers
model=Init_Freeze_ShiftSubtract_Layers(model, wave, momentum_direction=momentum_direction)

# Now compile your model as usual
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

```
