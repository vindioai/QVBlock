## ðŸ“– Quantum Vision (QV) Theory in Deep Learning

Inspired by quantum physics, **Quantum Vision (QV)** theory introduces a completely new perspective for object recognition in deep learning.  

QV takes captured still images of objects and converts them into **information wave functions** using a deep learning module called the **QV Block**.  

The QV Block can be integrated into:
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- Vision Transformers (ViTs)
- Convolutional Vision Transformers (CvTs)

These integrations produce **QV model variants** for object classification.

### ðŸ”¬ Key Highlights
- Converts image data into information wave functions.
- Enhances existing vision architectures by integrating the QV Block.
- Demonstrated **consistent performance improvements** across multiple datasets compared to standalone models.
